Unsupervised methods can reduce the cost of manual annotation which is a common requirement for video datasets.
### Unsupervised keypoint learning
Due to the similarity of pixels in consecutive video frames, the keypoints in each frame can be learned via unsupervised reconstruction of the other frames. Jakab\etal[<sup>1</sup>](#jakab2018conditional) propose to learn the object landmarks via conditional image generation and representation space shaping. Minderer\etal[<sup>1</sup>](#minderer2019unsupervised) introduce keypoints to video prediction using stochastic dynamics learning for the first time, which drastically reduces computational complexity. Gao~\etal~\cite{gao2021accurate} applied grids on top of~\cite{minderer2019unsupervised} for a clearer expression of the keypoint distribution.
