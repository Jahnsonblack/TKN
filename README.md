## Related Works
Unsupervised methods can reduce the cost of manual annotation which is a common requirement for video datasets.
### Unsupervised keypoint learning
Due to the similarity of pixels in consecutive video frames, the keypoints in each frame can be learned via unsupervised reconstruction of the other frames. Jakab [<sup>1</sup>](#jakab2018conditional) propose to learn the object landmarks via conditional image generation and representation space shaping.
